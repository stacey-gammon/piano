# Beat Detection Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

I've successfully integrated beat detection and metronome overlay functionality into your music looping tool. Here's what you now have:

### New Features
1. **`--beats` flag** for the `loop` command
2. **Automatic beat detection** using librosa
3. **Metronome click overlay** at detected beat positions
4. **BPM and timing information** display
5. **Downbeat detection** (every 4th beat for 4/4 time)

### Files Created/Modified
- **`music`** - Main script with beat detection integration
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies for beat detection
- **`install_beat_detection.sh`** - Installation script
- **`test_beat_detection.py`** - Test script for beat detection
- **`BEAT_DETECTION_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
- **`FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd py
./install_beat_detection.sh
```

### 2. Basic Usage
```bash
# Loop with metronome clicks
python music loop song.mp3 --beats

# Loop specific section with beats
python music loop song.mp3 --start :10 --end :30 --beats

# Multiple files with beats
python music loop song1.mp3,song2.mp3 --beats
```

### 3. Test Beat Detection
```bash
python test_beat_detection.py ../song.mp3
```

## What Happens When You Use --beats

1. **Analysis**: The tool analyzes the audio to detect tempo and beat positions
2. **Information Display**: Shows detected BPM, number of beats, and duration
3. **Metronome Creation**: Generates click sounds at beat positions
4. **Audio Mixing**: Overlays metronome clicks onto the original audio
5. **Looping**: Plays the enhanced audio in a seamless loop

## Example Output
```
=== BEAT DETECTION ===
Analyzing audio for beats and tempo...
Detected tempo: 120.5 BPM
Found 45 beats
Found 12 downbeats
Duration: 15.2 seconds
Adding metronome clicks...
Metronome overlay saved to: tmp/metronome_12345.wav

Press Ctrl+C to stop...
```

## Benefits for Learning Chords

- **Timing Reference**: Clear beat markers help you stay in time
- **Downbeat Emphasis**: Stronger clicks mark the beginning of each measure
- **No Manual Sync**: No need to manually start metronome and song together
- **Seamless Looping**: Perfect for practicing specific sections
- **Works with Vocal Separation**: Combine with your existing `split` command

## Technical Implementation

- **Graceful Degradation**: Works without beat detection libraries (shows warning)
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses temporary files for metronome overlay
- **Format Support**: Works with MP3, WAV, and other audio formats
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Install the dependencies** using the provided script
2. **Test with a song** you want to learn
3. **Try different time ranges** to focus on specific sections
4. **Combine with vocal separation** for even better learning experience

The feature is now ready to use and should significantly help with learning chord changes and staying in time with songs!
